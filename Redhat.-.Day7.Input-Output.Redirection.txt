TTY ---- askubuntu.com (karel)
Early user terminals connected to computers were electromechanical teleprinters or teletypewriters (TeleTYpewriter, TTY), and since then TTY has continued to be used as the name for the text-only console.

There are 6 virtual consoles in Ubuntu accessed by the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Alt+F1 to Ctrl+Alt+F6. You can move away from a text-only console (move the console to the background) by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F7.

e.g. tty

/dev/pts/0 


another terminal tty

/dev/pts/1
